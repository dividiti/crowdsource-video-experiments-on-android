NEWS
====
* Upcoming CK presentation at [ARM TechCon'16 (Oct. 27)](http://schedule.armtechcon.com/session/know-your-workloads-design-more-efficient-systems);
* ARM uses CK as a front-end for systematic and reproducible benchmarking and tuning of real workloads: [link](https://github.com/ctuning/ck-wa); 
* We have moved related Open Science resources [here](http://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Enabling-Open-Science);

Introduction
============

This [CK-powered](http://github.com/ctuning/ck) open-source Android application 
lets the community participate in experiment crowdsourcing using their 
mobile devices (mobile phones, tablets, IoT, etc)
and exchange knowledge via public CK servers.

You can download this app from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=openscience.crowdsource.experiments). 

You can also find public results at [Live CK repo](http://cknowledge.org/repo)!

Current scenarios include multi-dimensional and multi-objective
optimization of benchmarks and real workloads such as 
GCC and LLVM multi-objective crowd-tuning (performance / code size / bugs).

More information is available [here](http://cKnowledge.org/repo).
